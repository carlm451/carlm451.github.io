2. [Edge Signals & the Discrete Curl](https://carlm451.github.io/tdl-02-edge-signals.html) — B₁₂, oriented boundaries, 1-cochains, curl, Hodge Laplacian L₁
3. [Face Signals & the Hodge Story](https://carlm451.github.io/tdl-03-face-signals.html) — 2-cochains, L₂, Betti numbers, complete de Rham complex

**Part II — Topological Domains**
4. [Simplicial, Cell & Combinatorial Complexes](https://carlm451.github.io/tdl-04-complexes.html) — The hierarchy of topological domains

**Part III — Neural Networks on Topological Domains**
5. [Signals, Neighborhoods & Message Passing](https://carlm451.github.io/tdl-05-message-passing.html) — Cochains, adjacency types, HOMP
